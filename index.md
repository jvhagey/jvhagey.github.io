Currently, I am a Bioinformatician in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I am the bioinformatic domestic lead for the [Antimicrobial Resistance Labortory Network](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/laboratories.html). My team writes software, like [PHoeNIx](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix), to detect Antibiotic Resistance in Hospitial Associated Infections.

I got my PhD at the University of California, Davis in the Animal Biology Graduate Group with a designated emphasis in Host-Microbe Interactions. I am passionate about making "big data" in biology comprehensible and pretty. This home page will link you to my github projects. This page is still under construction 👷, but no hard hat needed. I currently write most of my work in python and R. Drop me a line if you find an error or have questions!
