I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis in the animal biology graduate group. I am passionate about making "big data" in biology comprehensible and pretty. This home page will link you to my github projects. This is a new page so still under construction üë∑, but no hard hat needed. I currently write most of my work in python and R. Drop me a line if you find an error or have questions!

## Projects
1. Fecal Microbiome of Dairy Cattle [github page](https://github.com/jvhagey/CDRF-CA_Dairy_Fecal_Microbiome) and the [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01093/full).  
2. Projects studying passive immunity in dairy calves:  
  - [Determining how serum IgG is related to mortality in the first 4 months of life in dairy heifers](http://doi.org/10.1017/S0022029915000503)  
  - [Clinincal trial of plasma as a treatment for failure of passive transfer in dairy calves](doi:10.1111/jvim.12586)  
  - [Evaluating the half-life of IgG from colstrum, colostrum replacer or bovine plasma](doi:10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.01.008)  
  - [Assesment of a commercial refractometer for onside evaluation of serum IgG and total milk solids](doi:10.1186/s12917-014-0178-7)  
  - [Evalution of failure of passive transfer rates in calves either bottle or tube fed colostrum](doi:10.2460/javma.241.1.104)  
3. Utility scripts I have written that I use for a varity of projects are found [here](https://github.com/jvhagey/Utility_Scripts).
