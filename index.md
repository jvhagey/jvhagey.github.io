I am currently an APHL Bioinformatics fellow in the Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

I got my PhD at the University of California, Davis in the Animal Biology Graduate Group with a designated emphasis in Host-Microbe Interactions. I am passionate about making "big data" in biology comprehensible and pretty. This home page will link you to my github projects. This page is still under construction üë∑, but no hard hat needed. I currently write most of my work in python and R. Drop me a line if you find an error or have questions!
